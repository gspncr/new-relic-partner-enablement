# Welcome, Partner Relic!

The purpose of these labs are to help you get the most out of your partnership with New Relic. The activities cover typical activities encountered by New Relic users.

The labs are written for use with AWS. You will be able to follow along with the labs if you are without a strong Linux, AWS, or New Relic background; but our advice is you take some time along the way to understand what is happening and context.

It is recommended you keep a document with screenshots with your progress in a diary format to help your learning, in addition to completing the self assessment form.

The lab is followed by a Capstone assignment present back. Note: completing the self assessment form is a pre requisite to attending the Capstone. The Capstone will be held at a New Relic office location. You will be given a demo scenario on the morning you arrive in the office with an example customer scenario, with the presentation in the afternoon. There is more information at the bottom of this page.

# Capstone Assignment

After completing the lab exercises, you must submit the self assessment form. Your sponsor will arrange a feedback session. On passing the labs, you will be invited by New Relic to prepare a Capstone presentation at a [New Relic office location](https://newrelic.com/about/contact-us).

<span style="color:orange">Our office locations are currently closed due to Coronavirus regulations, so Capstones will be held using video conferencing.</span>.

Your capstone scenario will be handed to you on the day of the presentation and you will present it to the New Relic team later that afternoon.

The New Relic team will be looking for in your presentation:

1. Consultative attitude towards the "customers" scenario
2. Correct feature placement, fitting the scenario
3. Confidence in platform and feature demonstration

You will need to create a New Relic account with sample data already populated there for driving your demonstration.

To prepare you for the Capstone assignment, here is some required reading that will help you prepare for the assignment and customer engagements:

# FAQ

### Is this the correct place to come to register as a partner?
No it is not. Head on over to the [New Relic Partner Program](https://newrelic.com/solutions/partners) for that.

### How long does it take to complete the labs?
Current testing shows this takes around 6 hours and 30 minutes. It is probably best to allow an entire day for this.

### What size instances do I need in EC2?
In CloudFormation you are asked to select an instance size. t2.micro instances work perfectly well.

### Are there any pre-requisites to the course?
It is expected you have been through the [New Relic Fundamentals series](https://learn.newrelic.com/series/fundamentals) before participating in the Enablement Labs.
A basic knowledge of AWS, command line (and SSH), and linux is assumed.

### Do I need to complete the self assessment form?
If someone from New Relic has invited you to participate in the Enablement Labs, then most likely the expectation is **yes**. The Capstone presentation (final stage of this enablement) requires you to have completed a self assessment form.

### Will you be providing AWS access?
No.

### Do I need a professional level New Relic account?
[Signing up for a free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) unlocks all entitlements. There is no credit card required. A free account is limited to 100GB ingest per month (more than enough for this lab series), it also provides unlimited basic users and limits to 1 full stack user.

### Can I give feedback?
Absolutely. Feedback drives the roadmap of the labs. You can leave a [request in GitHub](https://github.com/gspncr/new-relic-partner-enablement/issues/new), or, [leave feedback via Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelBxgP8y1fw1-4dIHG5qg8oVk_nlpsdUaFi5B5uOmhjAMQAA/viewform).

### Taking pull requests?
Always. [Please feel free to do so](https://github.com/gspncr/new-relic-partner-enablement/pulls).
